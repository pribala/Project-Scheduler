### Scheduler

Our application is a daily planning aid that helps users to view their friends /colleagues /instructors/ Ta’s calendar and plan or schedule appointment with them. 

The app aims to make it simple to schedule meetings and we can do it from a single dashboard.  All the group members publish their public google calendars which can be accessed from one page and we can schedule time with any member. The app adds the event to the calendar and sends the meeting notification by email to all the attendees. The way the app is designed now, only calendar owners can add an event to his or her calendar. Anyone else can add a request for a meeting which is visible to the calendar owner who then can approve and add the event to his calendar.
